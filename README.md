# Primitive-Music-Player
A simple Music Player...i mean... .
I know it looks like shit at the moment , however the program is in the building process

PlaySound doesnt work, i fix that.

Unfortunately, PlaySoundA() does not have autoplay or anything like that. I noticed that at the very end. I searched and found options for autoplay, and the code only needs to be adjusted in playMusic(). However, it will take some time because I have to read through it, understand it, and adjust it, which I am not particularly motivated to do at the moment due to frustration.

COMING SOON:

*Playlists.

*~~Automatic recognition of titles in music folders.~~

*Functioning playMusic(), as transition playList(). 
(Should enable it to run in the background without affecting the usability of the program and more than .wav).

*Skip.

*English screen text.
